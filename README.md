# Module 15 Challenge: MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to figure out the factors that are causing production troubles for a car manufacturing company's (AutosRUs) newest prototype, the MechaCar. In order to figure out these issues, I used the coding language R to perform robust statistical analysis on the company's given data sets for the MechaCar. Additionally, I designed a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vechicles from other manufacturers to evaluate whether the MechaCar was a viable competitor in the car-buying market.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Deliverable_1](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-15-MechaCar-Statistical-Analysis/blob/main/Images/Deliverable_1.png)
**- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**
The coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values were the intercept with **5.08e-08**, vehicle length with **2.60e-12**, and ground clearance **5.21e-08**.

**- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**
The slope of the linear model is **not** considered to be zero because the p-value is statistically significant, **5.35e-11**, which means the statistical analysis failed to reject the null hypothesis, and thus the slope of this model cannot equal zero.

**- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**
Since the p-value of this analysis is very statistically significant, it means that this linear model is reliable in predicting mpg for the MechaCar prototypes in an effective manner.
